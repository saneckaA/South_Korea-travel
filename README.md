# South Korea Travel 

In my first project I made the website about my 5 weeks travel to South Korea where you can find out some intresting things about this country. 
At the beggining you can read a little about me and by clicking buttons in nvigation you can go to one of three sections in which you can look through 
Korean quisine, culture and intresting places to visit there. Additionally in every section you can find the button which hide or show the section you've chosen. 
At the bottom of the site by clicking one of icons you will be transfer to instagram or facebook pages where you can find more riveting stuff 
or you can write to me an e-mail if you want to get know more about this beautiful country.
